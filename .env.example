# Auth is read from Cursor's mcp.json (~/.cursor/mcp.json), not from .env.
# In mcp.json, under mcpServers.datagroom.env set:
#   "DATAGROOM_PAT_TOKEN": "dgpat_...",
#   "DATAGROOM_GATEWAY_URL": "http://localhost:8887"
#
# This .env file is not used for PAT or gateway URL.
# Optional: you can set DATAGROOM_* in your shell environment to override mcp.json.
